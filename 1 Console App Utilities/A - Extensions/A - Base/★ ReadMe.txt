★★★★★ Numbering Rule


 - All file is classified into a folder that is converted from.

 - Num = 100 * (FileSystemInfo count) + (incremental num)


For example, "Save Csv"

 - input is double[][] → classified to "F - Data" → "F---"

 - output is FileInfo which is FileSystemInfo and input is not. → "F1--"

 - F101 is available → "F101"



★★★★★ Creating Rule

 - First, accept and return as FileInfo or DirectoryInfo if possible.

 - Second, accept and return as Image, Size or Point if possible.

 - not using async ideally for chaining
